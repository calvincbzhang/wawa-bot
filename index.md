# Welcome to WaWa Bot

A friendly and informative Whatsapp bot for COVID-19

## Mission

WaWa is your companion throughout this strange COVID-19 period. He is here to give you a short update on the progression of the virus. Make you laugh by sending you fresh memes and jokes. Provide you with the latest recommendations by the WHO. Bust those pesky myths. And much more. ðŸ¤¯

WaWa learns the human tongue as more users talk to him. And his guides (the developers), are constantly waiting for your input, as WaWa is hungry to help humans and give his contribution in this temporary period. ðŸ˜Š
